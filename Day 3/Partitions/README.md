* Tricky Question
* Really need to practice more of suffix and preffix array questions
* Had to go through the solution for both the approaches
* One approach is of ```O(nlogn)``` and the other is ```O(n)```.
* **O(nlogn) approach-**
  * prefix array and suffix array
  * Binary Search
* **O(n) approach-**
  * No binary search but used prefix and suffix arrays

* Beautiful question
* **Concepts learnt** - Suffix/prefix arrays, Binary Search
