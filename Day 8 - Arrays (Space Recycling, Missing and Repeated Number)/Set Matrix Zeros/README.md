* Great problem if solved in O(1) space, else easy one.
* Approach for O(1) -
	* We can use the first row and column for storing whether we have a 0 in that row or column.
* Approach for O(n+m) - 
	* We can make two new vectors for storing the same information as above.

* Time complexity - O(nm)
* Space Complexity - O(n + m)
