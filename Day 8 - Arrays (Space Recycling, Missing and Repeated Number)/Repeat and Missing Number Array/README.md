# Repeat and Missing Number Array

#### Medium

<hr>
<br>

**Approach -** 
* Made elements at the particular index negative, then checked if the element at that particular index is already negative, then the number is repeating.
* Traversed the array again and then if a number at an index is not negative, this means index+1 has not occured in the original array.
* Time Complexity - O(n)
* Space Complexity - O(n) ? Idk lmao XD
