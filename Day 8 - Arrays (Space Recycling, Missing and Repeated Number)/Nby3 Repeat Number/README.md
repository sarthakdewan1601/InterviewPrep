* ***Moore Voting Algorithm***
* We have done this algorithm for N/2 question.
* In this there is a possibility that more than 1 or exactly 2 elements can be the majority elements.
* Hence we maintain 2 counts to count the frequency of those majority elements.
* This approach was new to me and very similar to Moore Voting Algorithm.
* Time Complexity - O(n)
* Space Complexity - O(1)
