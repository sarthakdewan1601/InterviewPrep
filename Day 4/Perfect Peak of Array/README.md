# Perfect Peak of Array

#### Easy

Link - https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/perfect-peak-of-array/

* Simple question
* Did it in another way , as not mentioned in the editorial
* Editorial complexity - ```O(n)```
* My complexity - O(n<sup>2</sup>) (I think)
* Prefix and suffix max arrays were used in editorial , I wish I could have thought of that oof.
* Anyways, great problem as always, moving forward with more questions


***Cheers!***
