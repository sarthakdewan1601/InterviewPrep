* Wow Question
* Didn't know stacks are so awesome and cool
* Approach - 
  * Take a stack , num = 1
  * When encounter a 'D' , push num in stack, increase the num
  * When encounter 'I' , push the num in stack , increase the num and pop till stack is empty
  * In the end, push the num and and pop till stack is empty
  * The resulting sequence is the answer
